* specific instructions and requirementsfor lab 13

This and future labs will start with a mostly empty repository. 

You must:

1. Use ~doctest.h~ based tests to test your solutions unless a
   specific task says otherwise.
2. Have a ~Makefile~ with at least the following targets: 
   1. ~main~ to build *main* which will run your project
   2. ~tests~ to build *tests* which will run the doctest based tests
   3. ~clean~ which will remove *.o* files
3. At least three  ~.cpp~ files - ~main.cpp~, ~tests.cpp~ and at least
   one more with solutions to the labs. You will also need the
   appropriate ~.h~ files.


* Notes



* Task Specific instructions

The main lab describes one function for each task. You're solution
must have a main.cpp with main, tests.cpp with tests and at least one
more .cpp file (and .h to match) with each of the functions.

You must create a Makefile that includes targets for main, clean, and
tests and the program should not require any keyboard input. Compiling
and running tests should show that everything works correctly.

* Task A

Instead of a void function, make the function return as std::string
and you can then compare that with the desired output in your tests.

* Task E

I am requiring that you complete this task.

* Task F

This is optional but recommended as it's typical of a tech interview
problem.
